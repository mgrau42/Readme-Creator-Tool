## Readme-Creator-Tool

This repository contains a Python script for generating high-quality README files for your projects. The script uses Open AI to verify the software development technologies used in the project and then generate text and resources that are relevant to the project. It also uses natural language processing to create various sections of a README, such as a project description, installation instructions, usage examples, and more. The goal of this project is to make it easy for developers to create comprehensive README files for their projects. This README was Created with said tool. Pretty cool right?
