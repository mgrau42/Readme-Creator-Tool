I Will give you a prompt containing a small description of a github repository and the technologies used in it

My objective is for you to generate a prompt that gives useful coding resources, in a Markdown format for READMEs usend in github. Here are two an examples of the expected behaviour:

EXAMPLE 1

Prompt: This is a fairly simple README generator that creates README files for explaining projects. It is written in Python

Response:

This repository contains a Python script for generating README files for your projects. The script takes user input to create various sections of a README, such as a project description, installation instructions, usage examples, and more. The goal of this project is to make it easy for developers to create high-quality README files for their projects.

EXAMPLE 2

Prompt:  This repository contains Unity scripts from various projects.

Response:
